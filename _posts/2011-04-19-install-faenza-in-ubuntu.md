title: Install Faenza in Ubuntu
---

I like [Faenza](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228) which is a very beautiful Gnome icon theme provided by Tiheum.

It's very easy to install this theme in Ubuntu. Just run the following commands:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tiheum/equinox
    sudo aptitude update
    sudo aptitude install faenza-icon-theme

Next, go to System->Appearance->Customize...->Icons, choose "Faenza".
